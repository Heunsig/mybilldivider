This application helps people divide the bill after a meal at a restaurant.  
When we have a meal with our friends, usually we order different food. In the case, to split the bill for each person makes us annoyed.  
However, this application makes it easy. Just put your food and price in Mybilldivider. It will tell you how much to pay.
